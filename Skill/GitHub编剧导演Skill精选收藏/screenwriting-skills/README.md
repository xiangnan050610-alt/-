# screenwriting-skills

[中文版](README_ZH.md) · [日本語](README_JA.md) · [한국어](README_KO.md) · [Français](README_FR.md)

26 agent skills (for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) and [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/build-skills)) for screenwriting, television writing and dramaturgy, distilled from 47 craft books and 23 volumes of published scripts, scores and plays (Chinese, American, British, Japanese and Korean).

The skill files follow the open [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard and are shared by both agents: install once and it works in both.

**Ask in your own language.** The skill bodies are written in Chinese, because most of the sources are Chinese originals or Chinese translations. That is only where the text lives: ask in English, Japanese, Korean or French and you get the answer in that language. See [Multilingual support](#multilingual-support) for why there is a single source tree.

## Install

### Claude Code

#### Plugin marketplace (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add jtydhr88/screenwriting-skills
/plugin install screenwriting@screenwriting-skills
```

Skills are then invoked as `/screenwriting:<skill>`, e.g. `/screenwriting:sw-dialogue`.

#### Personal (all projects)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtydhr88/screenwriting-skills.git
cp -r screenwriting-skills/plugins/screenwriting/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Project-specific

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r screenwriting-skills/plugins/screenwriting/skills/* .claude/skills/
```

#### Verify

Skills load automatically when the agent detects relevant context. To list them: `/skills`.

### Codex (CLI / ChatGPT desktop app / IDE extension)

#### Plugin marketplace (recommended)

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add jtydhr88/screenwriting-skills

# Then, in the ChatGPT desktop app or Codex CLI:
# Plugins → select "Screenwriting Skills" → Install
```

The same 26 skill files are shipped through the plugin, with no duplication and no rewriting.

#### Personal skills (all projects)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtydhr88/screenwriting-skills.git
cp -r screenwriting-skills/plugins/screenwriting/skills/* ~/.agents/skills/
```

#### Project-specific

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -r screenwriting-skills/plugins/screenwriting/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

#### Verify

Run `/skills` to list available skills, or invoke one explicitly with `$sw-story-structure`.

## Usage examples

```
# "Break my 12-episode series into acts and place the act outs"
# → agent uses sw-series-structure

# "My dialogue is all on the nose, fix this scene"
# → agent uses sw-dialogue + sw-scene-craft

# "Turn this 400,000-word novel into a 40-episode Chinese drama outline"
# → agent uses sw-chinese-series-practice + sw-series-engine-bible

# "Set up a project and keep track of where I am"
# → agent uses sw-workflow
```

## Multilingual support

**One source tree, every language at runtime.** The skills are written once, in Chinese, and the agent delivers in whatever language you asked in.

This is a deliberate decision, and it was not the first one. There was an English edition once, a parallel `screenwriting-en` plugin with all 20 skills translated. It was proposed in [#3](https://github.com/jtydhr88/screenwriting-skills/issues/3), built, and merged. It has since been removed. The argument that killed it is the one that applies equally to every other language: if a reader who cannot read Chinese deserves a translated tree, so does a reader who cannot read English, and the next request is Japanese, then Korean, then French, then Russian. Five languages is 230 files that drift independently, with nothing to tell you which one is stale. The translation itself is cheap. The real cost is that forking once removes any principled ground for refusing the second fork.

So the line is drawn at the source, and the runtime does the rest:

- **Output language follows your question.** Ask in French, get French. No flag, no separate install.
- **Terminology is anchored to the original term.** The craft vocabulary of this field is originally English: *logline*, *act out*, *beat sheet*, *showrunner*, *staff writer*. The Chinese in the source books (计程绳, 出幕, 节拍表, 剧目管理人, 试用编剧) is the translation, and different translators chose differently. The term table in `sw-workflow` maps each concept back to its original term, so the agent restores the word. The same table serves all languages at once, because a Japanese or French screenwriter also says *act out* and *logline*.
- **Terms with no equivalent keep their original form plus a gloss.** 戏眼, 扣子, ト書き and 決定稿 come through as `戏眼 (xìyǎn — the one-line core attraction of an episode)`.
- **Your script stays in your script's language.** Discussing a Chinese screenplay in English is normal; the conversation switches language, the draft does not.

What this trades away is auditability: you cannot read the instruction file itself unless you read Chinese, only the agent's account of it. That is a real cost, and it is the one thing the deleted English edition genuinely bought. It was not worth a permanent five-way maintenance burden.

**READMEs are a different matter** and are translated, because they are short, stable, and the thing a newcomer meets first. The Japanese, Korean and French READMEs deliberately stop at install, structure and this policy; the full skill tables and the source bibliography live here and in the Chinese README, for exactly the reason above.

## How the skills are organised

Four layers. A feature project uses layers 1, 3 and 4; a series or stage project adds layer 2, because the medium layer replaces structure-for-film with the medium's own units.

```
1. General dramaturgy   premise · structure · character · dialogue · scene · format · Truby organic anatomy · genre anatomy · project workflow
2. Medium layer         series · episode & season structure · engine & bible · writers' room · half-hour comedy
                        stage  · Chinese opera: banqiang and qupai methods, each with a full-script case library
3. Tradition & trade    America · Japan · Korea & France · mainland China · the business
4. Master corpora       Chekhov · Ozu · Succession · television case studies
```

### 1. General dramaturgy (medium-independent)

| Skill | What it covers | Main sources |
|---|---|---|
| `sw-workflow` | Project orchestrator: a feature/stage stage-map (premise → structure → character → scenes → draft → revision → submission) **and a separate series stage table (S0–S7: engine → character web & season arc → documents → pilot structure → break story → draft → submission)**, naming which skill to call at each stage, per-stage deliverables and advisory exit checks, plus a story-bible convention (with a series supplement) that keeps project state in one file across sessions | meta-skill, no new sources |
| `sw-story-structure` | Paradigm & plot points, Save the Cat beats and board, McKee's event/scene/sequence/act, inciting incident, progressive complications, crisis-climax-resolution, subplots, Hoxter's nine beats, Hicks' attraction/anticipation/satisfaction, Lu Jun's 起承转合, eight openings, eight endings | Field, Snyder, McKee *Story*, Hoxter, Hicks, Lu Jun |
| `sw-premise-theme` | Premise as tyrant, controlling idea (value + cause), the "third rail" (desire vs misbelief), five premise questions, logline tests, 选材/开掘/视角/戏核 | Egri, McKee, Cron, Hicks, Hoxter, Snyder, Lu Jun |

| `sw-truby-anatomy` | Organic story anatomy kept side by side with the Field/Snyder page maps: the designing principle (premise expanded into deep structure), the seven key steps and all twenty-two steps as the organic spine, the middle-act machinery the beat sheets lack (ghost, fake-ally opponent, plan, opponent's drive, ally's attack, fake defeat, three revelation-and-decision pairs, audience revelation, visit to death, moral decision), four-corner opposition, the moral-argument chain with the hero-opponent power-balance rule, scene weave with structure-step tags and storyline numbers, the accordion rule | John Truby, *The Anatomy of Story* |
| `sw-genre-anatomy` | Genres as beat systems, kept beside the seven steps and the page maps: the three rules (hit every beat, mix three or four genres, transcend the primary genre), the ladder and families of twelve genres, each with a hero/opponent/world/plot-shape template, full beat list, hard rules with failure conditions, subgenres and transcendent paths (Anti-Western, Social Fantasy, Cosmic Detective, True Love, the Morality beats, the Sports and War beats), a genre-mixing worksheet and a twelve-question diagnostic | John Truby, *The Anatomy of Genres* |

### 4. Master corpora: complete primary texts, read and tabulated

| Skill | What it covers | Main sources |
|---|---|---|
| `chekhov-dramaturgy` | Chekhov's seven full-length plays and the one-acts as a working method: four-act mood structure without a central climax, off-stage events, three-layer endings, the *Wood Demon* → *Uncle Vanya* rewrite, with act-by-act tables and excerpts | 契诃夫戏剧全集 (焦菊隐/童道明/李健吾译) |

| `succession-series-writing` | All four seasons of *Succession*, 39 shooting scripts, as a working method for the streaming ensemble: the invisible-act tests, container episodes built on a ceremony's running order, pressure chambers, one core question per episode, humiliation passed downward, stage directions carrying subtext and "maybe", reversals turned on one word, writing long, alts, the mega-chart, and engineering an ending once the plot engine loses pressure | Jesse Armstrong, *Succession: The Complete Scripts* I–IV (Faber), with Frank Rich's and Lucy Prebble's essays |
| `sw-series-case-studies` | Worked episodes from primary texts: Sorkin's six *West Wing* teleplays (act-page tables, eight act-out types), Chase's five *Sopranos* scripts, Fellowes's annotated *Downton Abbey* season two (19 storylines, 419 author footnotes), *Fleabag: The Scriptures*, Calvisi's eight minute-by-minute pilot breakdowns, Landau's 47-series structure appendix, Miller's *Hannibal* and *HTGAWM* scene breakdowns, Goldberg & Rabkin's beat sheets, Sakamoto Yuji and Noh Hee-kyung | the published scripts and the case chapters of the books above |

Each skill has a main file (principles, checklists, workflow), and all but one also carry a reference file (tables, worked analyses, excerpts). Three skills split their tables across several files so each can be read in one pass: `sw-series-case-studies` into the four English script collections, the pilot beat sheets and structure tables from the craft books, and the Japanese and Korean texts; `sw-series-engine-bible` into engine teardowns, document field tables and filled samples; `sw-chinese-series-practice` into the craft reference, format and planning samples, the six adaptation cases and the content red lines.

## Stage genres

Film and television are covered. The stage is covered in part, the rest is planned, and there is a rule for what gets a skill and what does not.

**The rule.** A genre gets its own skill only if it makes the model write something with different structure, format or language rules. Subject matter (spy thriller, costume drama, family) and directorial style do not qualify; those are case studies inside an existing skill, unless a complete script corpus exists, as with Ozu.

**Chinese opera is two systems.** The axis that matters for a writer is the vocal system; the regional 剧种 comes second. In the **qupai system** (曲牌体: 元杂剧, 明清传奇, 昆曲) a lyric is filled into a fixed tune pattern with set line counts, lengths and tones; a 杂剧 runs four 折 and one 楔子 with a single role singing an entire 折; a 传奇 runs in 出. In the **banqiang system** (板腔体: 京剧, 豫剧, 越剧, 秦腔, 评剧, 沪剧) a lyric is built from paired seven- or ten-character lines varied by metre (板式), any role may sing, and the unit is the 场. Structure and lyric method both differ, so they are two skills. Regional 剧种 within one system differ only in which rhyme table (京剧十三辙 vs 豫剧中州韵) and which metre table they use, the same method with a different lookup, so they live as reference appendices; China has over three hundred 剧种, and one skill each would be the same combinatorial explosion as one tree per language. Two untidy edges: 粤剧 mixes both systems and is in Cantonese, whose tones and rhymes differ from Mandarin entirely, so whether it needs its own skill depends on whether the model's Cantonese phonology can use the tables, to be tested once material is in; 川剧 uses five vocal styles and its 高腔 is qupai, so it will appear under both.

**What is here now.** Four skills, distilled from 25 sources (twelve method and theory books, thirteen full scripts, scores and collected plays): a method skill for each vocal system and a full-script case library for each. The two method skills open with a boundary table that says, with sources, which general skills apply to an opera script and which do not, and share one file of common aesthetics and staging. Classical texts were taken from public-domain editions and checked against the originals; where a scan could not be verified (some 吴梅 and 白蛇传 passages) the notes say so, and the skills do not build rules on them.

**What is planned, in order.** Two gaps in the opera layer first: a per-tradition rhyme table for 豫剧 (the sources only give the principle) and a fourth-system edge for 粤剧, whose Cantonese phonology may need its own treatment. Then the spoken-theatre method China's own tradition adds beyond Chekhov: 曹禺's pressure-chamber structure and 老舍's portrait-gallery structure with no main line. Musical theatre last, because song carrying narrative is a genuinely different rule set and none of the current sources covers it.

**What is not planned.** Short-form vertical drama and AI-generated comic drama, whose logic is distribution, with no dramaturgy to distil. Skills split by subject, by director, or by regional 剧种.

**How a medium is added without polluting the general layer.** One new skill; one medium-boundary table inside it declaring what transfers; one row in `sw-workflow`'s entry-path table. The general skills are not edited. The series layer (13 → 20 skills) was added this way and `sw-story-structure` did not change; the opera slot was added the same way, and `sw-dialogue` got shorter.

## Conventions

- Skill bodies are Chinese; numbered principles, tables and checklists; cross-references between skills by folder name. Output language follows the user; see [Multilingual support](#multilingual-support).
- Agent-neutral by design: the skill files name no agent and use no agent-specific syntax, so the same skill file works under Claude Code, Codex, or anything else that reads the agentskills.io format.
- Where the sources disagree, both positions are kept side by side with a note on when to use which, for example Douglas's four-act grid against Oberg's "act breaks are only the size of the sausages", or theme-as-design against theme-as-emergent.
- Industry facts carry the year of their source, because rates, platforms and act counts date quickly; Chinese policy figures are marked 2014/2016.

## Technical notes

- **Files in each skill**: the main file is `SKILL.md`, the reference file is `reference.md`. `reference.md` holds worked examples and quotations so `SKILL.md` stays under ~40 KB. The three files of `sw-series-case-studies` are `reference.md`, `reference-pilots.md` and `reference-asia.md`.
- **Frontmatter**: every `SKILL.md` has `name` (kebab-case, matches the folder) and a long English `description` ending in "Use when …", with Chinese keywords in parentheses for triggering.
- **Plugins**: each plugin carries a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` over one shared `skills/` directory, so Claude Code and Codex read the same 26 `SKILL.md` files.
- **Term table**: [`sw-workflow/terms.md`](plugins/screenwriting/skills/sw-workflow/terms.md).
- **Story bible**: `sw-workflow` keeps project state in the file `story-bible.md`.
